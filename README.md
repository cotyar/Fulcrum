# Fulcrum
Distributed Ultra Scalable Database 

Staying on shoulders of Giants:
- Best in Breed storage
- Best in Breed netwoking
- Fit for purpose modern languages
- Proven big blocks, no reinvented bycicles

# plans

- *Grpc* for remoting
- Client-side *load balancing*
- *TLS* enabled communication
- *OAuth* Authentication
- *Protobuf* .proto files for stored data
- *Flatbufs* for stored data (as per *Apache Arrow*)
- *Async Rust* server
- Native clients for *Rust*,*.Net*,*Java*,*Javascript*
- *sled*, as embedded storage (millions/sec reads/writes for short data)
- Special treatment for long keys
- Special treatment for long 
- Zero-cost value cloning
- Long values partitioning 
- *CDN*-like *RLU* cache-through servers for value parts
- Server replication via *Raft* and _Reliable Casual Broadcast_ (with *CRDT*)
- *Merkle*-based data consistency
- "soft-delete" 
- keys *TTL* (expirations)
- *Orleans* inspired *distributed transactions* (aka external *ACID*) 
- *ACL*-based security
- *Regex* indices
- Native *sharding*
- Automatic *query optimisation*
- *SQL*
